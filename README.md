# 1411P2

1411P2 (Course 1411, Project 2) hosts the code for Team 6's main project.

## General Information

### What Is It?

We created a financial planner which allows students to spend more time on their studies rather than worry about their finances.

### What can it do?

This planner is capable of not only tracking income and expenses, but also interacting with your OU Student Account directly. This allows automatic coverage of student awards, loans that OU is aware of, and much more!

### Planner Math

All of the math behind this planner can be found here: https://github.com/Sage-A/Design-Project-1411
